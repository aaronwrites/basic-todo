# Basic Todo App

This is a basic Todo web application that I've created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I have added functionalities like,
 - Adding
 - Editing
 - Marking as complete
 - Deleting
I used render function and a component-based structure, even though it was implemented with vanilla JavaScript. I did this to practice and understand concepts that are fundamental in modern front-end frameworks like React.
